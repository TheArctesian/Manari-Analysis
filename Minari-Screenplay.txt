MONICA
[Where is daddy taking us?]
MONICA
[What is this place?]
JACOB
[What is this? This is home.]
DAVID
Wheels? Wheels? Whoa.
MONICA
[Really, what is this?]
DAVID
WHOA. WHOA.
MONICA
[You said you’d find a house in a big town.]
MONICA
[And how far is the hatchery?]
JACOB
[The hatchery...? That way.]
MONICA
[I asked how far. Is there even a grocery store here?]
JACOB
[Come here. Take a look at this. Look. Look at the color. This is why I picked this place.]
MONICA
[Because of the dirt color?]
JACOB
[This is the best dirt in America. We made a deal, remember?]
JACOB
Daddy’s gonna make a big garden.
MONICA
Garden Garden is small.
JACOB
Oh no, Garden of Eden. It was big like this...
ANNE                          
David! No running!            
MONICA
[David Don’t run!]
JACOB
[We wanted a new start, right?...Taste the air here.]
MONICA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[Snake.]
MONICA
[DAVID YOU PUT THAT DAVID]
MONICA
[This is not what we agreed.]
JACOB
[Don’t be like that; come look.]
JACOB
[Lift that leg... Now the other leg... Good job!]
MONICA
[Every place we move is worse and worse.]
ANNE
[Where should grandma’s picture go?]
MONICA
[We’re not staying. Leave it in there.]
ANNE
Is the murmur getting louder?
MONICA
[Mmm. We will need to keep checking. ...We need to find a home near a hospital too.]
JACOB
[Because it’s the first night here. Let’s all sleep together on the floor. Wouldn’t that be fun?]
ANNE
[No, daddy you snore!]
DAVID
[I wanna listen too.]
MONICA
[We’ll have to keep praying.]
MR. H
Hello everybody!
MR. H 
I introduce to you Mr. Jacob and Mrs. Monica Yi.
MR. H
Mr. Yi is an expert chicken sexer. He comes from Seattle and California. And let’s welcome him to Arkansas!
MRS. OH
[Hello.]
MONICA
[Oh hello, there are Koreans here!]
MRS. OH
[Yes, a few of us.]
MONICA
[I heard it’s was only Vietnamese.]
MRS. OH
[Oh no. There are a few Koreans. Fayetteville is bigger, but we all live in Rogers for the schools. Isthat where you moved...?]
MONICA
[Uh, no, we’re in a town called “Holt.”]
MRS. OH
[...I never heard of it.]
MONICA
[It’s an hour away, in the countryside.]
MRS. OH
[Why would a Korean move there?]
ANNE
I’ll read “V.” You start with “L.”
MRS. OH
[I’ve never seen anyone as fast as Mr. Yi. Surely he made more money in California.]
MONICA
[Yes, but I wasn’t fast enough to work there, so...]
MRS. OH
[When did you begin working?]
MONICA
[Six months ago.]
MRS. OH
[In any case, fast enough for here; you’re in just the right place!]
MONICA
[Go to your sister.]
MONICA
I’m sorry, we have no babysitter.
DAVID
Mom, what can I do?
JACOB
Daddy can take a break. Come.
JACOB
[David, it must be frustrating that you do not get to run.]
DAVID
[What’s that?]
JACOB
[That? Don’t worry about that.]
JACOB
[Male chicks are put in there. They’re discarded.]
DAVID
[What is ‘discarded?’]
JACOB
[That word is difficult right? Mm... Their meat is bad, they don’t lay eggs. Males have no use.]
JACOB
[So you and me should try to be useful, right?]
JACOB
[...Come, don’t go near.]
JACOB
Son. What do you think of the farm?
DAVID
It’s good.
JACOB
Better than California.
JACOB
[Right?]
DAVID
I don’t know.
JACOB
[When daddy was your age, grandfather had a big farm also. But I didn’t know it was good.]
DAVID
[Why didn’t you know?]
JACOB
[I just didn’t. After the war, we lost it all; that’s when I realized how good it was.]
JACOB
But, now it’s o.k. The farm daddy bought is much bigger than the one harabeoji lost...It’s a lot of land right?
DAVID
[It’s tons.]
JACOB
[Tons and tons right!]
JACOB
...And how small was our land in California?
DAVID
We had nothing.
JACOB
Now we have lots; isn’t that good? Good. Good. You tell mommy you like it o.k?. ...Let’s go inside.
JACOB
[First, empty its poop, or it can poop here, on your finger.]
JACOB
[Then look...]
JACOB
[It’s male.]
ANNE
[How do you know?]
JACOB
[I just know by the look. ...Now where’s a female...]
MONICA
[You should finish working.]
JACOB
[This is my last bin- a person so slow shouldn’t criticize me.]
JACOB
[Now look. This one, female.]
DAVID
[It’s the same.]
JACOB
[They all look the same. But daddy can sense something is different. It’s intuition. I’m not using this We don’t use our minds here. Only intuition.]
JACOB
[You train for months to learn this. Do you know that word,“intuition?”]
JACOB
Good. Fine. When you grow up, use your minds instead.
JACOB
[This is a job for stupid people.]
DAVID
Appa stop it!
JACOB
[The sky is green. It’s strange...]
MONICA
[There are four big towns, she said. The Koreans live in Rogers.If we move there, one of the Korean grandmothers can watch the kids.]
MONICA
[There’s a shopping mall there, a decent school ...and people.]
JACOB
[But we made a deal. We come here so you can work, and I can build a garden.]
MONICA
[You can get five acres in Rogers.]
JACOB
[Five acres is good for a hobby.Fifty acres... you see that was my dream.]
MONICA
[That place is your dream?]
JACOB
[We don’t even need a babysitter.No one is around to bother them.]
MONICA
[And what about-- What if something happens to him...?]
ANNE
David, let me see them again.
DAVID
Hey let’s give them Mountain Dew!
ANNE
No! Only water. O.k. David?
JACOB
[The car is ready. When it comes, we hurry and go.]
MONICA
[Go? Why?]
JACOB
[In a tornado, this kind of house can fly away.]
MONICA
[Stop looking. Go to the car.]
JACOB
[First we wait here and watch where it goes.]
MONICA
[Watch what!]
JACOB
[They report where the tornado is going on TV. Look.]
ANNE
[Mommy...]
JACOB
[See look. It’s now a “tornado watch,” no longer a “warning.” We worried for no reason!]
JACOB
[Are you crazy right now?]
MONICA
[Who’s calling who crazy?!]
JACOB
[Who is this all for? You! The kids!]
MONICA
[Speak truthfully.]
JACOB
[I worked ten years! Staring at chicken butts all day, coming home to a tiny apartment without a penny.]
MONICA
[And where did the money go? To the kids? Because your dream is for the kids?]
JACOB
[Don’t start.]
MONICA
[How much money went to the kids?]
JACOB
[I had duties as the eldest son, I had to take care of family, and now it’s over. Everyone at home is well now.]
MONICA
[Who’s home, my mother’s home? Our home? Who’s home are you talking about?]
JACOB
[I said stop!]
ANNE
Write it big.
JACOB
[Look at me. Have I ever done anything for myself? I’m trying to create a better life for us!]
MONICA
[Then why did you bring us to a flying home?]
JACOB
[This is why I can’t talk to you.]
JACOB
[We wanted a new start...This is it.]
MONICA
[Honey, if this is it, maybe there’s no chance for us.]
MONICA
[Anne! David! Go to the car.]
ANNE
[Mom. Why will the house fly away?]
MONICA
[It isn’t attached to the land.]
ANNE
[But why?]
MONICA
[Didn’t you see? The house is on wheels.]
ANNE
[But mom. The car is on wheels!]
JACOB
[Anne. If the tornado comes, we’ll drive to a safe place. Sit still.]
MONICA
[How about we pray Anne? Can you pray for us?]
MONICA
[Where’s our town on here?]
JACOB
[We aren’t on any map, hang on.]
MONICA
[Of course we aren’t on any map.]
ANNE
God please save our family. God please save our family...
DAVID
Sis! Sis! Sis!
ANNE
What is it?!
DAVID
Was the tornado a dream?
ANNE
No!
DAVID
My favorite... my favorite...
OZARK MAN
It was real dark. That’s when I heard it come rippin’ through. Real big.
MONICA
[Already awake?]
DAVID
[Mom, Anne said we have to move now. Do we really have to move?
MONICA
[David, when you have a family, will you choose a house like this?]
DAVID
[When I get married, I’m gonna live here ‘til I die.]
ANNE
[But Mom, when are we moving?]
MONICA
[Mm... Daddy and I talked a long time last night. We made a deal. We will stay. And Grandma will come and live with us.]
ANNE
[Mommy’s mom?]
MONICA
[Yes, and that means she’ll finally meet David... Isn’t that good?]
JACOB
[I’ll check the land.]
MONICA
[We’ll have to get this place ready.]
ANNE
[Why don’t you ever hang this up?]
MONICA
[This?]
ANNE
[In other houses they put up wedding pictures...]
MONICA
[Is that so? Maybe later...]
DOWSING DAN
That’s two-fifty for one good clean water well, three hunerd for two.
JACOB
Three “hundred?”
DOWSING DAN
Yessir. See, that’s how we start a farm in this country. I dowsed all the good wells up this road.
JACOB
No, we don’t need that.
DOWSING DAN
...I tell you what. Fella here before you tried to save money too.You heard what he did. Heh.
JACOB
[Stupid Americans, believing that nonsense. Koreans use our minds.]
JACOB
[Now. Look at the land. When it rains, where will the water go?]
JACOB
High place or low place?
DAVID
Low place.
JACOB
[Where is a] low place [here]?
DAVID
[...There?]
JACOB
[Yes. Where else?]
AVID
[There?]
JACOB
[Which place has water?]
DAVID
[There?]
JACOB
[Why?]
DAVID
[Trees like water.]
JACOB
[Digging a well is just like life.You pick one spot and dig. Don’t dig here and there. Stick to one spot. Then one day, you reach water. Understand?]
MONICA
[We need to get you both new shoes.There’s a clothing store in that little town.]
MONICA
[We’ll look our best for grandma.]
ANNE
[Mom, from now on, do we have to burn all our trash?]
MONICA
[Yes. Isn’t the city better? Careful of the smoke.]
JACOB
[Did we use a stupid stick? How did we find this?]
DAVID
[We used our minds!]
SALES LADY
Looky there! How pretty you are!
DAVID
[I wanna go to daddy.]
MONICA
[Tell him we’re almost done.]
RANDY
You’re a common sense man, Mr. Yi, taking land folks are too scared to buy. I respect a thinking man.
JACOB
Thank you.
RANDY
Now, lemme tell you, with farming these days you have to go big or go home-that’s just how it is.
RANDY
It’s a good time for it, Reagan’s out to make farmers happy. And I’ll be right here to help you.
PAUL
Hey there. My name’s Paul. If something’s wrong, you can call the owner. I’m just the one haulin’it.
PAUL
Now Mr. Yi, if you need, I drive these things all day, drive ‘em in my sleep. This a cattle farm?
JACOB
Fruit and vegetables.
PAUL
God bless you. I work crop farms all over. Don’t be scared of these tattoos, I’m a good worker.
JACOB
Thank you. But these are Korean vegetables. Korean fruits.
PAUL
Korean? Korean? Heh heh. You better take a look at this...
JACOB
This is old money! Korean War money.
PAUL
Yessir I was there. A hard time. I’m sure you know.Here, you wanna take it?
JACOB
Oh, he doesn’t need.
PAUL
I got more at home. You want it?
PAUL
Soon as I saw you, I knew, we’re gonna be friends. Can I pray?
JACOB
Sorry?
PAUL
Yes. Yes God. Thank you. Thank you for the Yi family. Mm. Ha ha! Thank you for this divine appointment. Amen. Yes. Big things, you got big things for this family.
DAVID
[Mom, did you look outside?]
MONICA
[How much was it?]
JACOB
[It’s an investment. We borrow, we pay back after harvest. In America, that’s how farming is done. ...Why are you smiling?]
MONICA
[So now it’s a farm, not a garden.]
JACOB
[Farm, garden, it’s all the same. Think of it as money. In three years, we won’t step foot in another hatchery.]
MONICA
[Just leave enough for David, that’s all I ask.]
JACOB
[Of course. You seem happy. Because mother is coming?]
MONICA
[Why?]
JACOB
[When you’re happy, you look quite pretty.]
MONICA
[Yes, don’t I?]
MONICA
[Who wants to try first?]
ANNE
[Dad, isn’t it better to grow American foods?]
JACOB
[Thirty thousand Koreans are moving to America every year. Do they miss Korean food?]
ANNE
[Yes.]
JACOB
[So how do you think a Korean farm will do?]
MONICA
[It’s because you’re shy?...Why don’t you like grandma?]
MONICA
[It’s not earwax, it’s dirt.]
MONICA
[Grandfather died during war. That’s why mommy has no brothers or sisters. You know?]
DAVID
[Yes.]
MONICA
[That means grandma has no one but us. But you say you don’t like her. Why not? ...Hmm? Don’t touch that; answer me.]
DAVID
[You always fight about grandma.]
MONICA
[Mommy fights about grandma, so you don’t like her?]
MONICA
[Hey. Mommy fought because grandma had health problems, and mommy couldn’t be with her. And mommy worries about leaving you alone. So if grandma is here watching you, will mommy fight?]
MONICA
[It won’t come off. This is from mommy’s work...Now let’s clip your nails. Look how long they are!]
MONICA
[My kids are so good looking!]
MONICA
[One more. Oh! They’re here!]
JACOB
[Grandma is here!]
ANNE
[Hello grandmother!]
SOONJA
[Hello! Is this Anne? Such a lady!]
MONICA
[David. Greet grandmother.]
SOONJA
[He’s hiding in mommy’s skirt!]
JACOB
[Come out. How embarrassing David!]
MONICA
[Mom, so you’re finally here...]
SOONJA
[You wanted to see me that badly? Fine. Now I’m getting tears too.]
MONICA
[Ahh this... You know, we can’t get the right kind here; we even drove 8 hours to Dallas, and it was all wrong.]
MONICA
[You brought this too!]
SOONJA
[Crying again? Crying over anchovies?]
MONICA
[You see the kind of life we’re living. I’m sorry mom.]
SOONJA
[Why? A house on wheels! So fun!...And take this, don’t say anything, just take it.]
MONICA
[No mom.]
SOONJA
[Just take it.]
MONICA
[No, no, keep it, hide it. I’m working now, mom. I should be the one giving you money.]
MONICA
[But where is this from?]
SOONJA
[It’s nothing. I sold the store.]
MONICA
[What about when you return?]
SOONJA
[You left Korea at a good time.
MONICA
[...then I’ll keep it safe for you and use it carefully for the kids.] 
SOONJA
[Will this one ever greet grandma?]
MONICA
[David, come here.]
SOONJA
[So this is the one who looks like me.]
MONICA
[What? Say it loud. She doesn’t look like a grandma?]
SOONJA
[Good boy. Because you say that, you get something.]
MONICA
[You’re giving Hwatu to a seven year old child?]
SOONJA
[If he learns now, he’ll beat allthe other bastards!]
SOONJA
[Fine. I’ll give you something else. You want to eat this?]
MONICA
[Ooh tasty, a chestnut. Go on! He’s never had one.]
SOONJA
[But... After the plane ride, it’s a little too hard. Hang on.]
SOONJA
[Eat it.]
MONICA
[Mom, you don’t have to do it that way.]
SOONJA
[Because it’s too hard.]
SOONJA
[He doesn’t mind sharing a room with grandma? I heard how American kids are.]
MONICA
[He’s not like that. He’s Korean.]
PAUL
You could think about doing something out here. An exorcism. Know what that is?
JACOB
Yes. No need.
PAUL
After what happened here. It’s no good, something like that.Out! In the name of Jesus, out!
JACOB
Ok! Now things will grow!
PAUL
Hey you keep spacing them holes too close. Oughtta be like this.
JACOB
No...
PAUL
You’ll get all leaves no cucumbers.Unless you grow it up?
JACOB
No, here to here. You know I went to an agriculture university in California.
PAUL
Oh ho. So you got a degree in cucumbers!
JACOB
I only studied two years.
PAUL
Ohhh that’s how smart you were!
JACOB
No, no. I didn’t finish. I ran out of money.
PAUL
Heh heh, good. I can tell you it’s a bad school, they’re tellin’ you cucumbers grow like that. Shoot man. We’ll grow ‘em the Arkansas way. You’ll be happy too. Get that away! In the name of Jesus!
JACOB
You’re a crazy man.
PAUL
Good. Keep that soil wet.
DAVID
[I hate it!]
MONICA
[Drink. Grandma brought it all the way from Korea.]
MONICA
[Drink it all. It’s expensive medicine.]
DAVID
[Grandma.]
SOONJA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[Don’t ever bring anything like this ever again.]
MONICA
[Stop David. You have to drink one every day.]
ANNE
Stop! Stop it! Go to your room!
MONICA
[David, go to your room.]
DAVID
There’s a Korea smell!
ANNE
You’ve never even been to Korea!
DAVID
Grandma smells like Korea.
JACOB
You talk about a Grandma smell?
JACOB
[Go get the stick.]
JACOB
[No? Then act properly in front of grandma. ...Go on, sleep.]
SOONJA
[Looks tasty! Can grandma try?]
DAVID
I want some.
ANNE
No, your drink is there:
SOONJA
[What is that?]
ANNE
[It’s water from the mountains. Dad said it’s good for your health.]
SOONJA
[Ohhh great! Give me...]
DAVID
[Grandma. You can’t cook?]
SOONJA
[No...]
DAVID
[Can you make cookies?]
SOONJA
[No why? Can you?]
DAVID
[Is there anything you can do?]
SOONJA
[EAT IT!]
SOONJA
[It’s a bbuk all you bastards!]
SOONJA
[Bullshit, you think you’re winning, look at this!]
SOONJA
[Fast, fast. Keep the game moving.]
MONICA
[Why didn’t anyone start a Korean church around here?]
MRS. OH
[With fifteen Koreans?]
MONICA
[It could be good. All the Korean kids can play together.]
MRS. OH
[The Koreans around here, we left the cities on purpose. ...To escape Korean church.]
ANNE
Did you know she can’t read?
DAVID
She isn’t like a grandma.
SOONJA
Oh! You like grandma!
ANNE
[We should go back.] David.
DAVID
Grandma’s going.
ANNE
David you have to be careful.
SOONJA
[So wonderful.]
ANNE
[Grandma, we can’t be here because of snakes.]
SOONJA
[Minari would grow very well here.]
SOONJA
[You American bumpkins don’t even know what minari is. Grandma brought minari seeds from Korea, and we can plant it there and there.]
ANNE
[David shouldn’t come here.]
SOONJA
[The water is nice and cold.]
ANNE
[David!]
MONICA
[Is this for the storm shelter?]
JACOB
[First we need a barn.]
ANNE
[There were so many bad things, I wrote them down.]
MONICA
[Mom’s tired; tell me some good things that happened today.]
ANNE
[Grandma pinched us with her toes.]
MONICA
[Anne...]
ANNE
[Oh. And David’s acting worse too.]
ANNE
See! You’re spying!
MONICA
[Both of you, no fighting. Mommy will make dinner, go and wait.]
SOONJA
[We should grow minari in the creek area. It’s just right for it.]
JACOB
[I’ll think about it.]
SOONJA
[Think about what? I’ll do it all.]
MONICA
[Mom, eat more of this.]
SOONJA
[That mountain water is tasty.]
MONICA
[No...leave it there, drink your water.]
SOONJA
[Hey, this is your favorite song.]
MONICA
[This song?]
SOONJA
[Anytime anyone asked you two to sing, you would sing this looking at each other all lovey-dovey. It’d make our skin crawl.]
MONICA
[Is that so?]
SOONJA
[They come to America and forget everything...]
MONICA
[David, it’s time to pray..]
MONICA
[Some kids prayed to see heaven in their dreams, and at night, God let them see it...One of the kids had a bad heart, and when he woke up, he was healed. What if you pray to see heaven while you sleep?]
DAVID
[You pray it. You go see heaven.]
MONICA
[It’s only for kids.How about it? Do you want to try?]
SOONJA
[Wah... you say all kinds of messed up things to that kid.]
MONICA
[You don’t have to pray it. But if you ever do, tell me what you see. I’m so curious.]
JACOB
[Practicing like that is no help.Those are too old.]
JACOB
[...You’re fast enough for Arkansas.]
MONICA
[If you’re not going to help me, don’t talk me.]
JACOB
[It must be lonely here without any friends.]
JACOB
[Even if mom is here, it’s not the same as having friends.]
MONICA
[Why are you saying this?]
MONICA
[Next time don’t hide it from me David.]
SOONJA
[Something must be broken down there. What’s it called in English?]
ANNE
“Penis.”
DAVID
[I dream that I’m peeing in the bathroom, but I wake up and I’m in the bed.]
MONICA
[From now on, before you pee, you think,]
MONICA
‘Is this a dream? Is this a dream?’
SOONJA
Pennis. Pennis.
SOONJA
[Is your pennis broken?]
DAVID
It’s not “pennis.” It’s called a “ding dong.”
CONGREGATION
'Perfect submission, perfect delight/ Visions of rapture now burst on my sight/ Angels descending, bring from above/ Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
BROTHER ROY
If this is yer first time with us, could you please stand? Oh don’t be ashamed, y’all stand up.
BROTHER ROY
What a beautiful family. We’re so glad you’re here!
JOHNNIE
What’s your name?
DAVID
David.
JOHNNIE
Hey David, why’s your face so flat?
DAVID
...It isn’t.
MONICA
Hello, I’m Monica. Nice to meet you.
DEBBIE
Well hi there! You are too cute.
BONNIE
How long y’all been in town, where you been hidin?
MONICA
I’m sorry, my English is not so good.
DEBBIE
Well that’s o.k.! We can teach you English.
BONNIE
She’d be in a world of hurt learnin’ English from us.
DEBBIE
We’ll teach her all our good words!
BONNIE
We only got four good words Debbie but Monica doesn’t get the humor.
MONICA
Yes. Thank you.
SOONJA
[There’s another one! So fat! So fat! Quickly look!]
MONICA
[Mom, stop that.]
JUNE
Hey, what’s that one called?
ANNE
[Cookie.]
JUNE
What about that one?
ANNE
[Grapes.]
JUNE
That one?
ANNE
[Bread.]
JUNE
That one.
ANNE
It’s just called a “pretzel.”
JUNE
That is sooo neat!
DAVID
[Can I sleep at his house?]
MONICA
[You have to sleep at home, with grandmother.]
DAVID
[I don’t like grandma!]
MONICA
[Don’t say that.]
JOHNNIE
No? Why can’t you?
SOONJA
Ding dong broken. Ding dong broken.
JACOB
[With English, you have to use it to learn.]
MONICA
[In any case, it’s better we just work on Sundays.]
JACOB
[If you don’t want to go back, why did you tithe so much?]
ANNE
What’s up there?
JACOB
Paul! What are you doing?
PAUL
It’s Sunday. This here’s my church.
JACOB
O.k. Do you need a ride?
PAUL
I’ll finish this. See you Monday.
JACOB
[Why? You like Jesus too.]
PAUL
We’re gonna build a barn. Alright!
JACOB
Have you built anything?
PAUL
Have I built anything? Of course I -...What is this?
JACOB
These are plans.
PAUL
We don’t need plans.
JACOB
Paul- we need plans.
PAUL
Stop. Wait.
JACOB
What?
PAUL
We build this now or later?
JACOB
Later.
PAUL
Jacob. This one too. No water. Bone dry.
SOONJA
[Ayoo, look at those muscles.]
DAVID
[You are not like a grandma!]
SOONJA
[Oh? What is a grandma like?]
DAVID
[They make cookies! They say nice things! They don’t wear men’s underwear!]
SOONJA
[Is that so?]
SOONJA
[Let’s drink that mountain water.]
SOONJA
[Then call Anne, let’s play Hwatu.]
SOONJA
[...You and me, we help each other win; we take all her money.]
DAVID
That’s bad.
DAVID
[Don’t do that!]
SOONJA
[David. Why don’t you like me? Hmm?]
DAVID
I am not pretty.
SOONJA
No no. Pretty, so pretty!
DAVID
I AM NOT PRETTY, I AM GOOD LOOKING!!!!!
PAUL
You make that? Pretty good!
JACOB
It’s easy.
PAUL
Might be a rock layer. If it’s a water table well, you won’t find nothing much deeper.
PAUL
How you figure it’s ground water?
PAUL
You could try calling one of these guys. So what you thinkin?
JACOB
When will it rain?
PAUL
...you asking me?
SOONJA
[Anne, did you hide the mountain water?]
ANNE
[We ran out!]
DAVID
Is this a dream? Is this a dream?
SOONJA
[Oh my, oh my, oh my!]
SOONJA
[Oh he’s killing him!]
DAVID
[Grandma, you want mountain water?]
SOONJA
[So well behaved. Sit and watch with me. ...Oh he hit him again!]
JACOB
[O.k. David. Now turn to grandmother. Apologize.]
DAVID
[I’m sorry.]
JACOB
[Do it properly.]
DAVID
[She’s not like a real grandma.]
SOONJA
[It’s o.k. From now on, don’t do such things. And I’ll try to be a real grandma. Ok?]
JACOB
[David, because you won’t bow properly, go get the stick.]
SOONJA
[No... Why would you hit that boy?]
JACOB
[Go get the stick.]
SOONJA
[Doing this to a pretty kid... He’s just a kid. So what? I drank pee.]
SOONJA
Who cares? It’s funny!
SOONJA
[Doing this to a pretty kid... He’s just a kid. So what? I drank pee.]
JACOB
[Bring it to me. Go get a new stick.]
JACOB
[Mother, we need to make sure he learns.]
MONICA
[It’s true mom, you’ve suffered too much in a place like this.]
SOONJA
[Shame and suffering! The way you both talk. This place is pure heaven to me. I’ll do better next time.]
MONICA
[Mom, you’ve come all this way to a hillbilly place, you don’t have to say that.]
JACOB
[See, only you call it ‘hillbilly.’]
MONICA
[We live in a hillbilly place, and now David acts like a hillbilly boy.]
JACOB
[Spoken like a true Seoul girl. Always looking down on country people.]
SOONJA
[Fighting over this??]
JACOB
[Let’s see.]
SOONJA
[Good job! Good job!]
JACOB
[Honey? Do this for me.]
MONICA
[Why are you acting like that?]
JACOB
[I worked so hard out there, I can’t raise my arms any higher.]
JACOB
[Hey... ...I need to wash my hair.]
JACOB
[Working outside sure makes life good. ...Ouch! You dig your nails when you don’t like what I say!]
MONICA
[We’re losing so much money I’m serious.]
JACOB
[It will be fine.]
JACOB
[I will fix everything. Understand? All of this, this backwards place, is something I’m doing for us. If this farm fails, take the kids and leave me for good. I deserve it.]
MONICA
[Lean your head forward.I’ve been wanting you to teach me something.]
JACOB
[What is it?]
MONICA
[Male?]
JACOB
Mm.
MONICA
[Female?]
JACOB
Mm.
MONICA
[Male?]
JACOB
Mm.
MONICA
[This one...]
JACOB
[That is why you are slow.]
MONICA
[But- look.]
JACOB
[What is your first idea?]
MONICA
[Male.]
JACOB
[Then it’s male.]
MONICA
[It’s not up to me.]
JACOB
[Not an ounce of doubt. Doubt means you’re thinking.]
MONICA
[But really. Just look at it.]
JACOB
[It doesn’t matter. You said it’s male. So believe it. When you work, you need absolute, complete faith in yourself. “There’s no one who does this better than me...”]
MONICA
[That’s not my personality.]
JACOB
[Then you’ll never be fast. I’m saying don’t use this. If you want to train your intuition, you can’t have doubt.]
MONICA
[Tell me if I’m right or wrong.]
JACOB
[You’re right. Male.]
JACOB
[Go in first.]
PAUL
But these fit the garlic.
JACOB
Cabbages here, garlic there. When you put inside-
PAUL
It’s all side by side.
JACOB
You sure?
PAUL
Well shoot. Space em for airflow. Ohhh don’t be smiling at me.
MONICA
[Jacob, phone!]
JACOB
[Who?]
MONICA
[From Dallas.]
PAUL
What happened?
JACOB
Take it back.
PAUL
Where they getting their produce?
JACOB
California.
PAUL
They just change it like that on you? ...we got some time Jacob to find someone else. It ain’t rottin’ on the vines.
JACOB
Korean people, living in big cities. You can’t trust them.
PAUL
Forget Dallas then. Must be other ones? OKC? Memphis?
JACOB
I have to go to work.
MRS. OH
[Already finished?]
ANNE
David, go change! It’s time to go!
DAVID
Where?
ANNE
Church picnic. Mr. Randy will be here.
DAVID
There’s no water.
ANNE
Doesn’t matter go change.
ANNE
[Grandma can you help him change?]
SOONJA
[Who cares what a little boy wears?]
MONICA
[Your arms are that sore again?]
MRS. OH
Put the box there; if any are injured, we have to throw them away.
DAVID
[SIS! GRANDMA!]
SOONJA
[Anne! Get your mind in order! Go get a towel quickly]
ANNE
[The church bus is here!]
SOONJA
[Go on. Leave David behind.]
ANNE
[I’ll stay.]
SOONJA
[You think I haven’t taken care of injured people? Go.]
ANNE
Mom will be so mad.
SOONJA
[There it’s done.]
SOONJA
[But why did you put the drawer back? How did you pick it up, such a heavy drawer?]
SOONJA
[Stand up. Try walking.]
SOONJA
Strong boy! Strong, strong boy.
SOONJA
[You’ve never heard that. But you are. You know? You are stronger than anyone thinks.]
DAVID
[Grandma?]
SOONJA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[What does pee taste like?]
SOONJA
[You rascal!]
DAVID
[Grandma, if you walk like this you can go fast!]
SOONJA
[Because you can’t run, you walk like this? Do you want to try running? Down to the tree there? Us. Together.]
DAVID
[I can’t.]
SOONJA
[...It’s fine. Let’s keep going.]
SOONJA
[The minari is growing well! ...You grew up in America so you never ate minari. But it’s the best food. It grows like weeds, so anyone can have it. Rich person. Poor person. Anyone can pick it and be healthy. You put it in kimchi, put in soup. When you are sick it is medicine. Minari is truly]
DAVID
Minari, minari, minari...
SOONJA
[What is that? Minari song?]
DAVID
[Minari, minari, wonderful minari.]
SOONJA
[Ah ha ha! Good! Sing again!]
SOONJA
[Why? You O.k.?]
DAVID
[It’s a cold wind. Minari says]
DAVID
Minari, minari, thank you thank you minari!
SOONJA
[Yeah! Yeah!]
DAVID
[Grandma! Look there!]
SOONJA
[David.]
SOONJA
[David! Stop it. Leave it. Otherwise it will crawl away and hide.]
SOONJA
[...with some things, it’s better to see them than have them hide.]
SOONJA
[You’re working hard.]
JACOB
[I’ll check the pipes.]
DAVID
[Dad, I made a road.]
SOONJA
[All day, we gathered it from the minari garden.]
MONICA
[It’s because of the water bill this happened. He thinks I don’t know. He used our water for the crops.]
SOONJA
[How will it be fixed?]
MONICA
[The bank, borrow more, I’m sure. Mom... I can take full care of us.]
SOONJA
[Don’t work too hard.]
MONICA
[But mom, how did you bring so much water?]
SOONJA
[That David. He’s stronger than you think. He helped carry all this.]
MONICA
[He’s not supposed to do things like that.]
SOONJA
[Even your idiot cousin Doo-won, that big bodied guy, at that age, he was much weaker.]
MONICA
[Mom, you really don’t know.]
SOONJA
[How can it be that bad? That’s how kids are, they get hurt and bounce back stronger.]
MONICA
[Even the doctors say he needs an operation any moment. Understand?]
SOONJA
[...what would I know next to a doctor?]
MONICA
[I’m sorry that you’re alone watching him more and more. But really, I only ask you to watch him carefully. Please.]
SOONJA
[O.k. O.k. I’ll do better.]
SOONJA
[What are you doing?]
SOONJA
[Why aren’t you sleeping? Hmm? What’s the matter?]
DAVID
[Mom said if I pray I can see heaven in my sleep.]
SOONJA
[...Ah, those kids who saw heaven?...Are you scared?...If you’re scared, don’t pray. It’s nonsense, you don’t have to go see heaven.]
DAVID
[But I prayed it! Grandma I prayed it, and now I don’t wanna go!]
SOONJA
[It’s o.k. It’s o.k. then pray,]
SOONJA
Oh my God! Oh my God no thank you!
DAVID
[But Grandma... then I would go to hell!]
SOONJA
[Hey hey hey, why are you already talking like that?]
DAVID
[...I don’t wanna die.]
SOONJA
[Ayoo. ...Come over here if you’re scared. Grandma won’t let you die.]
DAVID
[Grandma...]
SOONJA
[Shh. Shh. Shh. Who dares to scare my grandson this way? Don’t be scared. Don’t you know how strong you are? Here... Sing it again.]
SOONJA
[Minari, Minari, Minari! Minari Minari Minari!]
DAVID
[Minari. Minari. Minari.]
SOONJA
[Minari, Minari, Minari!]
DAVID
[Grandmother...]
ANNE
[Grandmother...]
DAVID
[Grandmother why did you wet the bed?]
SOONJA
[Leave me alone. Go!]
DAVID
Why is she like that?
ANNE
We’ll call mom from church. Get dressed. The bus will be here.
DAVID
O.k.
ANNE
Wait.
ANNE
Stay back, I’ll do it.
BROTHER ROY
When Jesus comes again, and we’re all gathered up, what a glorious day that will be!
ANNE
I’m going to call mom.
BROTHER ROY
Sit still kids. But what’ll you say when he asks, why is Rick from work, Sue from the bank, why is Earl from the grocery store not with us? Why didn’t you share the good news of salvation to these precious people? Boy I wouldn’t wanna have that conversation. Would you? s at the HWATU card in his hand.
ANNE
Mom and dad took grandma to the hospital.
OLDER KID
There’s that cross guy!
JOHNNIE
Think he saw?
OLDER KID
I heard he got a dirt floor and shits in a bucket. He don’t got no water where he lives.
ANNE
[Yes... There’s still no water. We can go get more from the minari garden. ...O.k. I will. O.k.]
DAVID
Lemme talk to her. Tell her we’re hungry.
ANNE
Bye.
DAVID
Really? ...How’s grandma?
ANNE
She wouldn’t say.
JOHNNIE
Now it’s your turn.
DAVID
O.k.
JOHNNIE
Fast as you can! No, flip me off! Flip me off!
JOHNNIE
My mom’s friend keeps this here. He don’ mind.
JOHNNIE
Wanna try some?
DAVID
Does it hurt?
JOHNNIE
It hurts if you eat it. So don’t eat it stupid. Put it like this.
JOHNNIE
I’m a cowboy!
DAVID
You won’t get points that way. Get the junk card, you’ll get a point. No that one! Use your mind!
JOHNNIE
This one?
DAVID
Now it’s my turn.
JOHNNIE
This a good game!
BILLY
How’s your daddy like that new farm?
DAVID
Good.
BILLY
He growin’ things good? Doin’ things right?
DAVID
Yes.
BILLY
Gooood. I knew the fella who was there before. You know about him?
DAVID
Yes.
BILLY
So you know what he did?
JOHNNIE
Who?
BILLY
Bucky Reed. Went flat broke. I guess that’s what a man does....You sure your daddy likes that farm? There ain’t no ghosts walkin’ round? I used to have a farm. Shoot. Even bigger than that up in Berryville. Tell yer mom I was here all night. You help your dad on that farm alright? Don’t be lazy.
DAVID
Yes sir.
JACOB
[Did you have fun?]
DAVID
Yes.
ANNE
What was your friend’s house like?
ANNE
Good. Kinda weird.
DAVID
Yeah.
ANNE
[Grandma?]
ANNE
[What are you looking at?]
SOONJA
[Leave it there. Or it will hide.]
ANNE
[Why is grandma like that?]
MONICA
[It’s called a “stroke.” She needs a lot of rest.]
ANNE
[How did it happen?]
MONICA
[It’s mommy’s fault. I was selfish and brought her here.]
ANNE
[Mom. Grandma will be o.k.]
MONICA
[You’ve grown up so much. Already seem like an adult. Mom is sorry to make you do so much. I left you both alone. It won’t happen again.]
JACOB
Please. Please.
ANNE
Mom wants to go back to California because of grandma. I heard them talking. They might get a divorce...
DAVID
When?
ANNE
They said they’re gonna check your heart and then decide. ...One of us should stay with dad, one of us should go with mom, don’t you think?
DAVID
[Grandma, it’s your fault. Everything is your fault. You came to America for nothing.]
PAUL
Thank you so much.
MONICA
[David help grandma.]
MONICA
[David! I said help!]
MONICA
[Mom, you already have water.]
SOONJA
[Him.]
PAUL
Oh no, don’t put that kimchi so far away. ...Sweating on my head.
MONICA
[Yes, thank you.]
MONICA
You are our first guest here.
PAUL
I am honored. Thank you. Wish I had something to offer in return. David. Won’t you come up here? Look at them. Look at them. Who’s the fool? I put junk in my veins,junk in my skin. Made these marks in prison- a sewing needle and ink from a ball point pen. That’s how foolish I was. Now I carry that big ol’ cross. You see it?
DAVID
Yes.
PAUL
I know what people think. You wanna put marks like these on those hands of yours?
DAVID
No.
PAUL
Good. Remember these hands David. You’re good kids. You remember. You and Anne both. Stay close to your Abba Father. Be glad and generous with what you have.
PAUL
Oh how I like this one! ...now where’d I put that box of oil?
MONICA
She sees something on this dresser.
PAUL
This one?
PAUL
...Out. Out. You dirty thing. Go.In the name of Jesus I cast you out... (back to praying in tongues)
PAUL
It feels lighter! Do you feel it?
MONICA
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Please. Wait right here. I have something.
PAUL
Do you want me to pray for you and... If you want.
JACOB
Why?
JACOB
PAUL
JACOB
Come early tomorrow. Lots of work.
PAUL
...You’re my dear friend Jacob, thank you for having me for this meal.
MONICA
Paul, please take this.
PAUL
What’s this? Oh ho thank you! You read my mind!
JACOB
[You used to say he has mental problems, now you ask him to do something like this?]
MONICA
[When did I say that? He came because he wanted to help us. I’m very thankful.]
JACOB
[What did you tell him about us?]
MONICA
[Why would I tell him anything?]
PAUL
This one’s good. And this. They won’t say no when they see these.
MONICA
[Mom, look, the food is all here. You don’t even have to heat this one, o.k.?]
MONICA
[Don’t try to help so much. Just rest, watch tv. ...we’ll be back late.]
SOONJA
[I’ll be o.k.]
MONICA
[Mom. I’m grateful for this.]
ANNE
Wake up David. Look!
MONICA
[We lived in a city even bigger. Do you remember?]
MONICA
[You’re bringing that inside?]
JACOB
[It’s too hot up here.]
MONICA
[Look at all the dirt on it.]
JACOB
[Then go in first. I’ll wait for a spot to open in the basement.]
MONICA
[We’re here for David.]
JACOB
[Go on in first. I’ll be right there.]
ANNE
Is it bad?
LAB TECH
She a good big sister?
DAVID
Yes.
LAB TECH
He a good little brother?
ANNE
Yes.
LAB TECH
Heheh. ...Alright buddy, you can sit up, get dressed, wait in the waiting room. How’s that sound?
ANNE
Good. Thank you.
LAB TECH
A good big sister.
JACOB
[Life was so difficult in Korea.When we married, remember what we said? That we’d go to America and save each other. Remember?]
MONICA
[I remember.]
JACOB
[What could we have known? Instead we came and fought so much that he was born this way.]
MONICA
[...Honey. Can’t you come with us? We can’t do this without you.]
JACOB
[I’m not the one who wants to leave.]
MONICA
[If I stay, we’ll go under. Only in California can we make enough to pay all the debts.]
JACOB
[We’d be chicken sexing til we die.]
MONICA
[Think about it for the kids.]
JACOB
[The kids need to see their father succeed at something for once.]
MONICA
[At what cost? ...Isn’t it better we stay together?]
JACOB
[Do what you want without me. Even if I fail, I have to finish what I started.]
DOCTOR
Mr. and Mrs. Yi? Come on in--
DOCTOR
This is where the blood flows out like a door - open close, open close. See how close the hole is? That’s why the California doctor said to wait on surgery til he’s older. But--you ready?--it looks like the hole is getting smaller.
MONICA
What?
DOCTOR
It’s still there, but comparing the measurements, it’s a significant improvement. It means we can rule out surgery, and we can see if the hole is closing up on its own.
DOCTOR
This is very good news.
MONICA
But the sound has gotten louder...
DOCTOR
Yes. Sometimes, as the hole gets smaller, the sound gets louder. Loud is good. ...Are we happy?
MONICA
Yes. Thank you.
JACOB
Thank you very much.
DOCTOR
Must be the Ozark water.
ANNE
Good job David.
MONICA
[Your father needs to make a stop. Then we’ll eat. Are you hungry?]
ANNE
[I want naeng myun!]
MONICA
[Naeng myun? We’ll see which place has the best naeng myun. Get in.]
JACOB
[It’s been a while since we’ve heard good news.]
MONICA
[It’s a miracle...]
JACOB
[I told you it would be fine...]
ANNE
Look!
OWNER
[Shrewd business idea, many Koreans are moving to this area...]
JACOB
[Yes, and most of your produce comes from California, so it arrives badly, with no taste. We‘re five hours away.]
OWNER
[Very good.]
JACOB
[What day is good? My wife she works, so I can come any time.]
JACOB
[Did you see?They have so many Korean foods now.This is perfect timing. The owner said that. Soon he will build a bigger store.]
JACOB
[Mom is in shock and can’t say anything.]
MONICA
[Anne. Take the keys. Go take your brother to the car and get in.]
MONICA
[Go on.]
JACOB
[What is this?]
MONICA
[You act like nothing happened...Just now at the hospital, when you had to choose between the farm and the family, you chose the farm.]
JACOB
[It doesn’t matter, everything worked out.]
MONICA
[So if our circumstances are good, we’re able to live together, but when they aren’t, we fall apart?]
JACOB
[What kind of talk is that? From now on we make good money, we can live in peace.]
MONICA
[So we can’t save each other, but money can?]
MONICA
[The truth is, I grew used to the idea of a divorce... David is better, and that’s just as well. One day this kind of thing will happen again, and you’ll fail completely, and it’s inevitable what will happen to us.]
JACOB
[Then that’s it. Even after all this, you don’t believe in me. I feel the same way.]
OWNER
You’re still here!
JACOB
[We’re on our way. We’ll see you soon.]
DAVID
[...Mom.]
MONICA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[I prayed to see heaven.]
MONICA
[You did?]
DAVID
[I saw it.]
MONICA
[Good. Thank you for telling me. Sit back in your seat, David.]
JACOB
[Don’t come out!]
MONICA
[Jacob!]
MONICA
[Jacob!]
JACOB
[Go! Don’t be here! Stay with the kids!]
MONICA
[Jacob!]
JACOB
[Monica! Monica!]
ANNE
[Mom! Dad!]
ANNE
[Grandma!]
DAVID
Grandma!
DAVID
[GRANDMA!]
DAVID
[GRANDMA!]
DAVID
[Grandma. Grandma...]
ANNE
[Grandma. This is not the way.]
ANNE
[Grandma, our house is that way.]
DAVID
[Grandma.]
DAVID
[Grandma! Grandma! Don’t go! Come home with us! Grandma! Come home with us!]
PAUL
O.k. mark it. That’s where it is!
MONICA
[Go on.]
JACOB
[Go on first, I’ll meet you.]
DAVID
[Daddy, where are you going?]
JACOB
[You want to come? Let’s go.]
JACOB
[Hand me that.]
JACOB
[It grows even when we don’t do anything... Grandmother picked a good spot.]
